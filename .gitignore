# Ignore crash log files
crash.log

# Ignore local configuration file that might contain sensitive data
# Only include if 'terraform.tfvars' itself is NOT meant for version control.
# If you use a 'terraform.tfvars.json' or 'local.tfvars' for secrets, you'd add those instead.
# For this example, we'll exclude the main tfvars file, assuming it has secrets.
terraform.tfvars

# Ignore the lock file which specifies exact provider versions
.terraform.lock.hcl

# Ignore the history file (if using a Unix-like shell)

# This may include files like '*.retry' logs or temporary editor files.

# Ignore custom/local configuration that overrides 'ansible.cfg'
# Only add this if you generate a temporary 'ansible.cfg' or similar.
# In your current tree, 'ansible/ansible.cfg' is already present and should be tracked.

# Ignore Python virtual environment files (if you use one)
# This is a common practice for dependency management.
